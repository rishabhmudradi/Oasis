INTRODUCTION
------------
Monitoring and managing an FBLA chapter can be intense and time-consuming. In fact, numerous officers have 
been posing the same question: is their a better way? This was the core reason for why we created Oasis, 
an intuitive and immersive iOS application that provides both chapters and their members with the
ability to relay and receive information with ease. With our numerous features ranging from quick sign-ups 
for competitions to efficient attendance scanners, FBLA members can spend their time focusing more on their
individual competitions. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------
  - In order to run Oasis an apple phone runing iOS 10.0+ os required.

INSTALLATION
------------
 - Oasis is not available on the iOS App Store.
 - User must run application through the Xcode simulator or personal device.


SOFTWARE USED
-------------
We used Xcode 11.3 during development of this iOS application. For the app's icon and a 
large majority of our user interface, we used Sketch to enhance our colors. Finally, we used 
Github to store our code online to ensure all members of our team would be able to collaborate on 
the most updated version of our code.


SOURCES
-------
Since all members of our team had prior experience with iOS development, we did not use many outside 
sources. Instead we referred to each other, youtube, or stack overflow for assistance. All of the code 
and interface used to develop Oasis was created from scratch.  

Open-Source Frameworks
  - None :) 
SDKs
  - Firebase iOS SDK (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

Other Assets
  - Icons were provided from FlatIcoin (https://www.flaticon.com)

User Interface
  - All of our user interface was developed in sketch and imported into Xcode for usage.



TEMPLATES
---------
No templates were used to develop Oasis.
